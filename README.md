## Hi there my name is Joseph De Jesus üëã
**Software Engineering Graduate from Arizona State University Polytechnic**

----

I‚Äôm Joseph, a Software Engineering student at Arizona State University Polytechnic, passionate about building impactful projects and expanding my technical knowledge.

## 2025 Work Experience üñ•Ô∏è
 
Since April 2025, I‚Äôve been interning as a Quality Assurance Engineer at Pawgo, a Phoenix-based startup. 
In this role, I‚Äôm actively developing my expertise in end-to-end testing using Playwright, focusing on building reliable, automated test suites to ensure a seamless user experience across the platform. 
I‚Äôve also gained hands-on experience writing YAML configuration files and setting up GitHub Actions workflows to integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 2024 Work Experience üèä

Since May 2024, I‚Äôve served as an Age Group Swim Coach for the Seville Country Club Sharks in Gilbert, Arizona.
Though coaching may seem unrelated to software, it‚Äôs given me an incredible opportunity to leverage my skills in Google Suite and web development. 
I‚Äôve created websites and spreadsheets to enhance team communication and organization, and developed a web app called the ‚ÄúPractice Maker‚Äù to help coaches better visualize and manage training routines.


## What I am currently working on

My current work at Pawgo as a QA Engineering Intern focuses on testing, automation, and system reliability:

 - End-to-End Testing with Playwright: Writing and maintaining automated tests to ensure the stability and usability of core platform features.

 - CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Creating and managing YAML configuration files to integrate Playwright tests into continuous integration workflows.

 - Test Coverage Expansion: Auditing existing test cases and expanding coverage to include edge cases and newly released features.

 - Bug Reproduction & Reporting: Identifying, reproducing, and documenting bugs in coordination with the development team to support faster issue resolution.

## Languages and Tools

My skill set spans a range of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools, allowing me to approach problems with a versatile mindset and select the best solution for each project.
